# dynamic_pricing

I used this code during the Bundesliga Hackathon for developing a dynamic pricing model for Eintracht Frankfurt. The approach closely follows the methodology presented in the paper "How Efficient is Dynamic Pricing for Sport Events? Designing a Dynamic Pricing Model for Bayern Munich" by Kemper and Breuer (2016). The resulting analysis produces similar graphs and insights to those shown in the original paper.
